00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:02.09
- [Instructor] When using
Three.js, you will need to serve

2
00:00:02.09 --> 00:00:06.04
your HTML file through a
server to be able to load in

3
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:09.07
some of the assets that we
will be using in this course.

4
00:00:09.07 --> 00:00:12.05
If you are looking for a
server that is easy to set up,

5
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:15.00
you can use Python to start a simple

6
00:00:15.00 --> 00:00:18.00
HTTP server using this comment.

7
00:00:18.00 --> 00:00:21.01
This comment assumes
you are using Python 2.

8
00:00:21.01 --> 00:00:23.09
If you are using Python
3, this is the comment

9
00:00:23.09 --> 00:00:27.05
that you should use, or you
could install third party

10
00:00:27.05 --> 00:00:31.00
solutions as well, I'm using
a tool called live-server

11
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:33.03
that I installed through MPM.

12
00:00:33.03 --> 00:00:35.06
It supports live reloading of files

13
00:00:35.06 --> 00:00:37.05
whenever there is a change in them.

14
00:00:37.05 --> 00:00:40.02
You can find that tool on this page.

15
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:42.02
You will have the server running

16
00:00:42.02 --> 00:00:44.08
at the root of the project files.

17
00:00:44.08 --> 00:00:48.06
We can start live-server
by typing live-server

18
00:00:48.06 --> 00:00:52.03
inside the terminal, I will
have the server running

19
00:00:52.03 --> 00:00:54.09
at the root of my project files.

20
00:00:54.09 --> 00:00:57.06
If you want to use Three.js in production,

21
00:00:57.06 --> 00:00:59.05
you can find the minified version

22
00:00:59.05 --> 00:01:02.02
of the library on their GitHub page.

23
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:05.05
A minified file is smaller
in size and has more

24
00:01:05.05 --> 00:01:08.07
efficient use in production,
why debugging is harder

25
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:11.06
when using a minified
file is the error messages

26
00:01:11.06 --> 00:01:14.04
that you get can be a bit cryptic.

27
00:01:14.04 --> 00:01:17.07
Therefore, for development
and for our purposes

28
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:20.04
in this course we will
be using a non-minified

29
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:23.04
version of the Three.js library.

30
00:01:23.04 --> 00:01:26.08
You can find both the minified
and non-minified versions

31
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:31.00
of Three.js library on
their GitHub repository.

32
00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:34.04
I have already included Three.js
in project downloadables.

33
00:01:34.04 --> 00:01:37.00
At the time of this recording, Three.js

34
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.04
is at the release number 85.

35
00:01:39.04 --> 00:01:42.02
Here we have a pretty simple HTML file.

36
00:01:42.02 --> 00:01:44.03
We are loading in the Three.js library

37
00:01:44.03 --> 00:01:46.07
for it to be available for our use.

38
00:01:46.07 --> 00:01:49.02
It has been loaded on this line.

39
00:01:49.02 --> 00:01:51.07
We are also pointing to
another JavaScript file

40
00:01:51.07 --> 00:01:55.01
which we will be creating to
write our Three.js codes in,

41
00:01:55.01 --> 00:01:57.02
which is this line.

42
00:01:57.02 --> 00:02:00.00
The HTML has a div
amount with a unique ID.

43
00:02:00.00 --> 00:02:02.06
We will be using this
ID to be able to select

44
00:02:02.06 --> 00:02:05.00
the div amounts from our JavaScript code,

45
00:02:05.00 --> 00:02:07.04
and append our 3D content to it.

46
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:09.03
You also have some very simple

47
00:02:09.03 --> 00:02:11.08
styling declarations that is here.

48
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:15.09
Here in our main .js file,
which is right now anti,

49
00:02:15.09 --> 00:02:20.08
I will just type in console.log(THREE)

50
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:23.03
to ensure that Three.js library

51
00:02:23.03 --> 00:02:27.01
is properly loaded, and
now inside the browser,

52
00:02:27.01 --> 00:02:29.03
inside the console of the inspector,

53
00:02:29.03 --> 00:02:32.05
I can see the Three.js
library being loaded.

54
00:02:32.05 --> 00:02:36.06
We are now ready to start
writing Three.js code.
