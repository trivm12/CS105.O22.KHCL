00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:03.05
- [Narrator] WebGL is a
low level JavaScript API

2
00:00:03.05 --> 00:00:06.05
that enables creation
and display of 3D content

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:09.02
inside the browser using the GPU.

4
00:00:09.02 --> 00:00:11.07
It's supported by every
modem browser out there,

5
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:15.02
except for some older versions
of IE and Android browser.

6
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:18.09
Unfortunately, since
WebGL is a low-level API,

7
00:00:18.09 --> 00:00:21.09
it can be a bit hard and tedious to use.

8
00:00:21.09 --> 00:00:24.02
You need to write
hundreds of lines of codes

9
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:26.08
to even perform even the simplest tasks.

10
00:00:26.08 --> 00:00:31.00
Three.js on the other hand
is an open-source JavaScript

11
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:33.08
library that abstracts away
the complexity of WebGL

12
00:00:33.08 --> 00:00:36.09
and allows us to create
real-time 3D content

13
00:00:36.09 --> 00:00:38.06
in a much easier manner.

14
00:00:38.06 --> 00:00:40.03
In this course, we will be learning

15
00:00:40.03 --> 00:00:42.01
about this amazing technology.

16
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:44.09
Three.js have been around for a while

17
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:47.09
and have a great support
and community behind it.

18
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:50.07
Visiting the Three.js website,
you can check out the links

19
00:00:50.07 --> 00:00:53.02
on the main page and see
the amazing body of work

20
00:00:53.02 --> 00:00:55.04
created using this library.

21
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:58.02
I will just quickly show
you three of my favorites.

22
00:00:58.02 --> 00:01:01.03
Here is a 3D data visualization

23
00:01:01.03 --> 00:01:04.00
that displays the global
oil imports and exports

24
00:01:04.00 --> 00:01:06.01
for various countries.

25
00:01:06.01 --> 00:01:08.06
You can be interacting
with the visualization

26
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:11.06
and see the data for various countries

27
00:01:11.06 --> 00:01:13.09
and for various years as well.

28
00:01:13.09 --> 00:01:16.08
This a game of visualization
and an exercise

29
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:20.04
on how far you could be pushing
the 3D graphics on the web.

30
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:23.02
I really like the photo
realism on this one.

31
00:01:23.02 --> 00:01:25.06
And this another Three.js exercise

32
00:01:25.06 --> 00:01:27.01
that I really like as well.

33
00:01:27.01 --> 00:01:29.00
This is a product page for Renault,

34
00:01:29.00 --> 00:01:32.01
where you can see and
interact with the car in 3D.

35
00:01:32.01 --> 00:01:35.08
You can even animate it with
pressing these buttons here.

36
00:01:35.08 --> 00:01:38.03
It's impressive that this kind of content

37
00:01:38.03 --> 00:01:40.04
can now be created inside the browser

38
00:01:40.04 --> 00:01:42.05
and can run cross
platform without the need

39
00:01:42.05 --> 00:01:44.09
of any plugins or add ons.

40
00:01:44.09 --> 00:01:48.04
In these examples, you
can see clear use cases

41
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:50.02
of how Three.js can be leveraged

42
00:01:50.02 --> 00:01:53.06
in the context of entertainment,
advertisement, education,

43
00:01:53.06 --> 00:01:55.03
or E-commerce.

44
00:01:55.03 --> 00:01:59.00
With the inevitable rise
of VR and AR, 3D content

45
00:01:59.00 --> 00:02:02.04
is bound to become an even
larger part of our lives.

46
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:04.07
Three.js makes creating and distribution

47
00:02:04.07 --> 00:02:06.06
of such content really easy,

48
00:02:06.06 --> 00:02:10.00
using one of the most
accessible technology platforms

49
00:02:10.00 --> 00:02:10.08
of all time.

50
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:11.08
The browser.
