1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.03
- [Instructor] Looking
back at the main js file,

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:06.01
I'm noticing that the
"get box" function takes

3
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:09.05
width, height, and depth as arguments,

4
00:00:09.05 --> 00:00:12.03
but is not really making use of them.

5
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:14.03
So I'm going to change this,

6
00:00:14.03 --> 00:00:16.09
and get rid of the hard coded values here,

7
00:00:16.09 --> 00:00:20.06
and make use of the width,
height, and depth values.

8
00:00:20.06 --> 00:00:22.04
So that when we are calling this function,

9
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:26.02
we can actually parameterize
the creation of the box.

10
00:00:26.02 --> 00:00:29.07
And now, I'm going to add a
plane to the screen as well.

11
00:00:29.07 --> 00:00:30.09
For this purpose,

12
00:00:30.09 --> 00:00:33.03
I can use the plane geometry object.

13
00:00:33.03 --> 00:00:36.01
Plane geometry requires
us to pass the width,

14
00:00:36.01 --> 00:00:37.07
and the height parameter

15
00:00:37.07 --> 00:00:40.08
to set the size of the plane
that we would like to create.

16
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:42.01
So to be able to do so,

17
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:43.09
I will create a dedicated function

18
00:00:43.09 --> 00:00:46.03
for plane as well.

19
00:00:46.03 --> 00:00:48.05
Just like how I created
the "get box" function,

20
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:51.09
I'm going to create a
"get plane" function,

21
00:00:51.09 --> 00:00:56.02
using most of the parameters,
or commands that I used here,

22
00:00:56.02 --> 00:00:59.05
and name it, instead of "get box,"

23
00:00:59.05 --> 00:01:01.03
"get plane,"

24
00:01:01.03 --> 00:01:07.04
and I'm going to be calling
the "plane geometry" function.

25
00:01:07.04 --> 00:01:09.09
Plane geometry have a different signature

26
00:01:09.09 --> 00:01:11.03
than box geometry.

27
00:01:11.03 --> 00:01:13.05
It works with width,

28
00:01:13.05 --> 00:01:16.02
and depth values,

29
00:01:16.02 --> 00:01:18.08
so I'm going to be
passing a single argument

30
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:20.04
to the get plane,

31
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:22.01
and I will be using it,

32
00:01:22.01 --> 00:01:23.02
to (speaks softly) here,

33
00:01:23.02 --> 00:01:24.05
to be able to set the width

34
00:01:24.05 --> 00:01:26.06
and the depth

35
00:01:26.06 --> 00:01:29.01
of the plane geometry.

36
00:01:29.01 --> 00:01:31.02
And now this is pretty much it,

37
00:01:31.02 --> 00:01:33.01
but one more thing that we need to do

38
00:01:33.01 --> 00:01:35.00
when creating a plane function,

39
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:36.08
or plane object in three.JS,

40
00:01:36.08 --> 00:01:40.06
is we need to define a size
parameter here as well.

41
00:01:40.06 --> 00:01:44.00
Because in 3D, 2-dimensional flat objects

42
00:01:44.00 --> 00:01:47.01
don't have both of their
sides displayed by default.

43
00:01:47.01 --> 00:01:50.01
So to be able to see the
other side of the objects,

44
00:01:50.01 --> 00:01:52.01
we need to pass a attribute called

45
00:01:52.01 --> 00:01:55.05
"three.doublesides"

46
00:01:55.05 --> 00:01:57.05
for the 2D objects as well.

47
00:01:57.05 --> 00:02:00.07
Having done this, we should
be able to get a ground plane

48
00:02:00.07 --> 00:02:02.00
on our scene.

49
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:03.03
So here,

50
00:02:03.03 --> 00:02:06.06
I'm going to be calling that function,

51
00:02:06.06 --> 00:02:09.01
by providing the value 4 to it.

52
00:02:09.01 --> 00:02:13.08
And I will be adding the
plane to the scene as well.

53
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:16.06
Every time we are creating
an object in three.JS,

54
00:02:16.06 --> 00:02:18.06
we need to add it to the scene

55
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:20.09
to be able to see it.

56
00:02:20.09 --> 00:02:23.02
And now, if I am to save the scene,

57
00:02:23.02 --> 00:02:24.08
and look at the results,

58
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:26.08
I should be able to see a plane.

59
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:27.09
Perfect!

60
00:02:27.09 --> 00:02:29.08
Now we are seeing the plane as well,

61
00:02:29.08 --> 00:02:32.02
but plane is using the
same color as the box,

62
00:02:32.02 --> 00:02:34.02
so we can't really tell the difference.

63
00:02:34.02 --> 00:02:37.03
So I'm going to go back and
change the color of the plane

64
00:02:37.03 --> 00:02:38.03
to red.

65
00:02:38.03 --> 00:02:42.01
Here instead of using the hex
value for the green color,

66
00:02:42.01 --> 00:02:45.05
I will be using the hex
value for the red color.

67
00:02:45.05 --> 00:02:49.03
And now we have a red
plane, on the screen.

68
00:02:49.03 --> 00:02:52.02
But I would like to have this
plane horizontal to the ground

69
00:02:52.02 --> 00:02:59.01
so that I will rotate it 90
degrees around this x axis.

70
00:02:59.01 --> 00:03:01.09
Now, if I am to go back to Chrome,

71
00:03:01.09 --> 00:03:03.02
and look at the scene,

72
00:03:03.02 --> 00:03:05.07
I can notice that the rotation happens,

73
00:03:05.07 --> 00:03:07.09
but it doesn't seem to be 90 degrees,

74
00:03:07.09 --> 00:03:09.08
it seems to be less than that.

75
00:03:09.08 --> 00:03:11.04
Or it could be more than that as well,

76
00:03:11.04 --> 00:03:14.06
but it doesn't seem to be the
90 degrees that I provided.

77
00:03:14.06 --> 00:03:16.01
The reason for that is,

78
00:03:16.01 --> 00:03:18.03
three.JS is using radiants,

79
00:03:18.03 --> 00:03:21.01
instead of angles, to do rotation.

80
00:03:21.01 --> 00:03:24.01
90 degrees in radiants
would be the pi value

81
00:03:24.01 --> 00:03:25.05
divided by 2.

82
00:03:25.05 --> 00:03:28.00
We can get the pi value
using the Javascript

83
00:03:28.00 --> 00:03:29.06
math object.

84
00:03:29.06 --> 00:03:31.08
So I'm going to go back to my code,

85
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:33.08
and instead of using 90 degrees here,

86
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:36.01
I'm going to be calling "math PI"

87
00:03:36.01 --> 00:03:38.00
to be able to get the pi value

88
00:03:38.00 --> 00:03:40.01
and divide it by 2.

89
00:03:40.01 --> 00:03:41.07
This should provide me

90
00:03:41.07 --> 00:03:44.04
with the 90 degrees that I'm looking for.

91
00:03:44.04 --> 00:03:45.04
Perfect!

92
00:03:45.04 --> 00:03:47.01
Now you would notice,

93
00:03:47.01 --> 00:03:49.02
some portion of the cube seems to be under

94
00:03:49.02 --> 00:03:50.08
the plane geometry.

95
00:03:50.08 --> 00:03:52.02
The reason for this is that

96
00:03:52.02 --> 00:03:54.08
the box geometry gets placed in the scene

97
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:56.01
from a center,

98
00:03:56.01 --> 00:03:59.03
meaning that half of the box
will be under the ground plane.

99
00:03:59.03 --> 00:04:01.08
Let's move the box half
of its current size,

100
00:04:01.08 --> 00:04:04.08
which is 1, so that box
will remain on the plane.

101
00:04:04.08 --> 00:04:07.08
So I'm going to go back, and here,

102
00:04:07.08 --> 00:04:11.07
I'm going to position the box

103
00:04:11.07 --> 00:04:13.09
on the y axis

104
00:04:13.09 --> 00:04:15.07
by 0.5,

105
00:04:15.07 --> 00:04:18.04
and doing so should move the box on top

106
00:04:18.04 --> 00:04:19.06
of the ground plane.

107
00:04:19.06 --> 00:04:22.07
This is good, and works
for our current purposes,

108
00:04:22.07 --> 00:04:25.00
but if the height of
the box were to change,

109
00:04:25.00 --> 00:04:27.02
then you would need to
update this code as well.

110
00:04:27.02 --> 00:04:30.02
This is only working for
a box of the height 1.

111
00:04:30.02 --> 00:04:32.00
A better way of going about this

112
00:04:32.00 --> 00:04:34.05
would be to fetch the height of the box,

113
00:04:34.05 --> 00:04:36.00
the current height of the box,

114
00:04:36.00 --> 00:04:39.01
and use that value for
the positioning purposes.

115
00:04:39.01 --> 00:04:41.02
We can get the height value of the box

116
00:04:41.02 --> 00:04:43.04
from its geometry attribute.

117
00:04:43.04 --> 00:04:45.06
So instead of hard coding the value here,

118
00:04:45.06 --> 00:04:50.03
what I can do is, I can call
the "box geometry" attribute,

119
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:52.02
look at its parameters,

120
00:04:52.02 --> 00:04:54.07
and get the height value from here,

121
00:04:54.07 --> 00:04:56.03
and divide it by 2.

122
00:04:56.03 --> 00:04:58.05
Doing so, we should be
able to position the box

123
00:04:58.05 --> 00:05:01.02
from its bottom, instead
of it's being positioned

124
00:05:01.02 --> 00:05:02.06
from its center.

125
00:05:02.06 --> 00:05:04.01
So let's look at the scene,

126
00:05:04.01 --> 00:05:06.03
and we will see that the
box is being positioned

127
00:05:06.03 --> 00:05:08.06
from its bottom points right now.

128
00:05:08.06 --> 00:05:11.01
No matter what the height of the box is,

129
00:05:11.01 --> 00:05:13.07
it will always remain on the grids.

130
00:05:13.07 --> 00:05:15.02
Having done all this,

131
00:05:15.02 --> 00:05:17.08
we built a very simple scene in three.JS.

132
00:05:17.08 --> 00:05:21.00
Granted our scene doesn't
look like much at the moment,

133
00:05:21.00 --> 00:05:23.03
but we will be improving
the look of the things

134
00:05:23.03 --> 00:05:25.07
as we learn more about
the three.JS features

135
00:05:25.07 --> 00:05:27.03
in the next chapter.
